Classic snake game created entirely in a texture in unity. Runs smoothly and even has a simple bloom and simple VHS effect made by me. Main menu is also made by me as a little experiment I wanted to make, that is why it looks so primitive!

The start buttons are for different things:
  -Big Button -> Start
  -Little Button left -> Randomize player color
  -Little Button center -> Randomize background color
  -Little Button right -> Randomize point color
