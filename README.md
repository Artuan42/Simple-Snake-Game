Classic snake game created entirely in a texture in unity. Runs smoothly and even has a simple bloom and simple VHS effect made by me. Main menu is also made by me as a little experiment I wanted to make, that is why it looks so primitive! Something cool you could make with it is putting as an easter egg on some TV in your game.

The start buttons are for different things:
  -Big Button -> Start
  -Little Button left -> Randomize player color
  -Little Button center -> Randomize background color
  -Little Button right -> Randomize point color
  
  Pressing the R key will reinitialize the game and the escape will exit the application.
